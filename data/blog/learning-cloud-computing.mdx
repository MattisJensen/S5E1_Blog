# What is Cloud Computing?

Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale. You typically pay only for cloud services you use, helping you lower your operating costs, run your infrastructure more efficiently, and scale as your business needs change.

# How is it to learn it at SDU?
I am positively suprised how well Mahyar and Barney are leading the course. They are very good at explaining the concepts and are very patient with us students.
Of course it's also fun to give some nasty answers to the quizzes and see how they react.
